# team-profile-genarator

Building an team-profile-genarator (project)

# Description - Why did build a team profile genarator?
The main purpose to build a team profile genarator is so that the user can enter the responses within the command line with promted questions. This will then result in generating a html file with their responses that has been provided in the command line. 

This project has not only enhanced my skills in javascript but the introduction to node and using the command line in the terminal has opened a new world of using the programme. Additional knowledge gained includes: Node (inquirer), Jest, writeFile, tests, switch, prompt, .then, .this, .get, super, return on top of previous acquired javascript skills.

# What does this project do?

The user is able to respond to the questions asked in the terminal which then generates a html file based on their answers. This is done by typing node.js in the command line and then prompts up the questions.

# Criteria set to achieve this?

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
